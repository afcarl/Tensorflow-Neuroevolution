author: Paul Pauls

* Created and set up project repository and development environment

* Created and set up development log

* Processed phone call notes and created extensive private notes, roadmap and ToDos

* I studied up on Tensorflow and existing Reinforcement Learning Architectures (Explicitely those of Tensorforce and Tensorlayer as they are closest to the project) 

* Read research papers 'Large Scale Evolution of Image Classifiers' and 'Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search' in detail as those are the Google Brain research papers recommended by Rezsa.

* Future Work: Agreed with Rezsa that the next two weeks until the official start of GSoC 2019 on the 27th. of May shall be spent planning, learning and designing the TF-Neuroevolution framework architecture to enable a better final product
