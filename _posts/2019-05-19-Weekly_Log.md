title: Development Log of Week 1 (13.-19. May 2019)
author: Paul Pauls

* Created and set up project repository and development environment

* Created and set up development log

* Processed phone call notes and created extensive private notes, roadmap and ToDos

* I studied up on Tensorflow and existing Reinforcement Learning Architectures (Explicitely those of Tensorforce and Tensorlayer as they are closest to the project) 

* Read research papers 'Large Scale Evolution of Image Classifiers' and 'Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search' in detail as those are the Google Brain research papers recommended by Rezsa.

* Future Work: Agreed with Rezsa that the next two weeks until the official start of GSoC 2019 on the 27th. of May shall be spent planning, learning and designing the TF-Neuroevolution framework architecture to enable a better final product



* Task: Read into existing Neuroevolution/NEAT projects to study their architecture (especially NEAT-Python) and again read more into traditional reinforcement learning architectures.
 
* Task: Created an architecture-draft of a basic evolutionary algorithm / reinforcement-learning architecture. I expect it to be somewhat presentable/discussable tomorrow
