title: Development Log of Week 1 (13.-19. May 2019)
author: Paul Pauls
---

* _Task_: Created and set up project repository, development environment and development log


* _Task_: Processed phone call notes and created extensive private notes, roadmap and ToDos


* _Task_: Read up on Tensorflow and read into Architectures of the following Reinforcement Learning Frameworks to check reference work of others:
  - Tensorforce
  - Tensorlayer
  - Deepmind RTFL
  - Google Dopamine
  - OpenAI Baselines
  - RLLib


* _Task_: Created first architecture-drafts of basic evolutionary algorithm / reinforcement-learning architectures. Will upload in the coming days when matured enough.


* _Research_: Studied up on the following Research papers:
  - 'Large Scale Evolution of Image Classifiers' 
  - 'Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search'
  - 'Neuroevolution: From Architectures to Learning'
  - 'The Age of Analog Networks'


* _Thought_: Possible Big-Picture Project Milestones:
  - Implementation of a basic Neuroevolution framework in TF 2.0 that maximizes
    in performance and offers drop-in implementation of various specific
    Neuroevolution algorithms
  - Implementation of various specific Neuroevolution algortihms that are fitted to the 
    created Neuroevolution framework. Possible Algorithms: NEAT, HyperNEAT,
    ES-HyperNEAT, Novelty-Search, CoDeepNEAT, etc
  - Extensive Documentation of framework 
  - Extensive Addition of training examples with established RL test environments
  - Extensive test-coverage
  - Visualization of Neuroevolution process and progress via Tensorboard
  - Possible Integration into Tensorflow Ecosystem once it is of sufficient
    quality


* _Future Work_: Research to read:
  - [Research by Claudio Mattiussi](https://sites.google.com/site/claudiomattiussi/Publications), especially his PhD Thesis 'Evolutionary Synthesis of Analog Networks'


* _Future Work_: Further read into established RL architectures and brainstorm first drafts of the Tensorflow-Neuroevolution architecture
